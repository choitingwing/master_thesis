# Error estimation of neutrinos energy

These code is base on my master thesis: "DiVa link"
The estimation is done by two methods: Likelihood Inference and Normalising Flows

Tensorflow was used in Likelihood Inference. Pytorch was used in Normalising Flows. You can find the code in difference branches.
