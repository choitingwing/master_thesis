# Error estimation of neutrinos energy using Deep Learning technique.

These code is based on my master thesis: http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1670984&dswid=-951

The estimation is done by two methods: Likelihood Inference and Normalising Flows. 

Tensorflow was used in Likelihood Inference. Pytorch was used in Normalising Flows. You can find the code in difference branches.

Some trained models and result plots are inside the codes.
